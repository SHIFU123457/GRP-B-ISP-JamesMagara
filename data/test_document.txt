    Data Structures and Algorithms - Week 1 Notes
    
    Stack Data Structure:
    A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
    Elements are added and removed from the same end, called the top of the stack.
    
    Main operations:
    - Push: Add an element to the top of the stack
    - Pop: Remove and return the top element
    - Peek/Top: Return the top element without removing it
    - isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
    
    Queue Data Structure:
    A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
    Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
    
    Main operations:
    - Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue
    - Dequeue: Remove and return the front element
    - Front: Return the front element without removing it
    - isEmpty: Check if the queue is empty
    
    Applications:
    Stacks are used in function calls, expression evaluation, and undo operations.
    Queues are used in scheduling, breadth-first search, and handling requests.
